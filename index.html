<!-- 
like react redux is also a library that helps us to manage the state of our application.
 It is built on top of Redux and provides a set of tools and utilities to make it easier to work with Redux in a React application.
 using react-redux, we can connect our React components to the Redux store and access the state and dispatch actions without having to write a lot of boilerplate code 
 
 store global var type vha se sab chize lenge
 reducer konse sub_store me change krna h
 useSelector jb koi val store se select krni ho
 useDispatch jb koi value store me dalni ho , dispatch reducer ko use krte hue store me value add krta h-->
